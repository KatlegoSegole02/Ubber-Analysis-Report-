Uber Trip Analysis Dashboard - Power BI Implementation
Project Overview
This repository contains the Power BI solution for analyzing Uber trip data. The goal of this project is to provide an interactive dashboard that enables stakeholders to make data-driven decisions by examining key performance indicators (KPIs) related to booking trends, revenue generation, and trip efficiency.

Business Requirements:
Dashboard 1: Overview Analysis

Analyze Uber trip data to gain insights into booking trends, revenue, and trip efficiency.

Help stakeholders make informed decisions through dynamic visuals and key metrics.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Total Bookings – The total number of trips booked over a given period.

Total Booking Value – The total revenue generated from all bookings.

Average Booking Value – The average revenue per booking.

Total Trip Distance – The total distance covered by all trips.

Average Trip Distance – The average distance covered per trip.

Average Trip Time – The average duration of trips.

Expected Outcomes:
Identify trends in ride bookings and revenue generation.

Analyze trip efficiency based on distance and duration.

Compare booking values and trip patterns across different time periods.

Provide insights to optimize pricing models and improve customer satisfaction.

Power BI Implementation
Dynamic Measures and Visuals
Measure Selector: A disconnected table was created with the following values:

Total Bookings

Total Booking Value

Total Trip Distance
These values are used to dynamically update the visualizations based on user selection.

Filters:

By Payment Type (Card, Cash, Wallet, etc.)

By Trip Type (Day/Night)

Enhancements:

Dynamic Titles: The chart title updates dynamically based on the selected measure.

Slicers: Filters for Date, City, and other metrics to enable deeper analysis.

Tooltips: Provide additional details such as Average Booking Value or Trip Distance on hover.

Vehicle Type Analysis
A grid table (Matrix or Table visual) was created to analyze KPIs across different Vehicle Types in Uber trips.

Key Metrics: Total Bookings, Total Booking Value, Avg Booking Value, Total Trip Distance.

Conditional Formatting: Highlight high and low values to visualize performance.

User Interactivity: Sorting and filtering enabled for a customized view.

Daily Trip Trends
Total Bookings by Day:

Detect trends in daily trip volumes.

Identify peak and off-peak days.

Understand the impact of external factors (holidays, events, weather) on ride demand.

Support strategic planning for resource allocation and pricing adjustments.

Location Analysis
Analyze key trip locations for optimized ride distribution and demand forecasting:

Most Frequent Pickup Points: Identify common starting locations for trips.

Most Frequent Drop-off Points: Determine the most common end locations.

Farthest Trip: Identify the longest trip based on distance traveled.

Total Bookings by Location (Top 5): Identify the top 5 locations with the highest number of trip bookings.

Most Preferred Vehicle for Pickup Locations: Understand which vehicle type is most frequently booked at each pickup location.

Other Implementation Enhancements
Bookmark for Data Details:

A bookmark was created to display a pop-up or side panel with:

Definitions of key metrics (Total Bookings, Total Trip Distance, etc.).

Descriptions of tables used in the analysis.

Data source and refresh frequency.

Clear Slicer Button:

Added a "Clear Filters" button that resets all slicers with one click.

Improves the user experience for quick dashboard resets.

Download Raw Data Button:

A button to export the raw data in CSV or Excel format.

Uses Power Automate or built-in Power BI Export functionality for easy access to the underlying data.
